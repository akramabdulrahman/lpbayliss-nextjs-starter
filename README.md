# NextJS TypeScript Starter

## What is this project?

This project is support to act as a starting point for any of my personal react based projects. It contains some tools I would always include in a new project as well as some general defaults.

## Some of the tools used in this project include;

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
